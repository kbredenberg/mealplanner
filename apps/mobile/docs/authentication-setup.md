# Mobile App Authentication and Navigation Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication and navigation structure implemented for the meal planner mobile app. The implementation follows the requirements specified in task 8 of the meal planner specification.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Authentication Context (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Features:**

- Better Auth integration with React Native
- Secure session storage using Expo SecureStore
- Automatic session refresh every 5 minutes
- Proper initialization state management
- Comprehensive error handling

**Key Methods:**

- `signIn(email, password)` - Authenticate user with email/password
- `signUp(email, password, name)` - Register new user
- `signOut()` - Sign out and clear session
- `refreshSession()` - Refresh current session

**State Properties:**

- `session` - Current user session
- `user` - Current user data
- `isLoading` - Loading state for auth operations
- `isInitialized` - Whether auth context has been initialized

### 2. Protected Route Component (`components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)

**Features:**

- Automatic redirect to sign-in for unauthenticated users
- Loading states during initialization and auth operations
- Fallback component support
- Proper handling of authentication state changes

### 3. Enhanced Auth Client (`lib/auth.ts`)

**Features:**

- Better Auth configuration with request/response interceptors
- Proper error handling and logging
- TypeScript type definitions for Session and User

### 4. Authentication Utilities (`lib/auth-utils.ts`)

**Features:**

- Email validation with regex
- Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Name validation (2+ characters)
- Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- Alert helpers for consistent error display

### 5. Navigation Hooks (`hooks/useAuthNavigation.ts`)

**Features:**

- `useAuthNavigation()` - General auth-based navigation
- `useRequireAuth()` - For protected routes
- `useRedirectIfAuthenticated()` - For auth screens

### 6. Enhanced Authentication Screens

**Sign In Screen (`app/auth/sign-in.tsx`):**

- Email and password validation
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states and disabled buttons during auth
- Responsive design with keyboard avoidance

**Sign Up Screen (`app/auth/sign-up.tsx`):**

- Comprehensive form validation
- Password confirmation matching
- Strong password requirements
- Name validation

### 7. Navigation Structure

**Root Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`):**

- AuthProvider wrapping entire app
- Disabled gesture navigation for better auth flow control
- Proper theme integration

**Auth Layout (`app/auth/_layout.tsx`):**

- Automatic redirect if already authenticated
- Disabled swipe gestures on auth screens

**Tab Layout (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`):**

- Protected with ProtectedRoute wrapper
- All tabs require authentication

**Index Screen (`app/index.tsx`):**

- Initialization and loading handling
- Automatic routing based on auth state

## Authentication Flow

1. **App Launch:**
   - AuthContext initializes and checks for stored session
   - Index screen shows loading while initialization completes
   - Automatic redirect to tabs (if authenticated) or sign-in (if not)

2. **Sign In Process:**
   - User enters credentials
   - Client-side validation (email format, required fields)
   - Better Auth API call
   - Session stored securely in device storage
   - Automatic redirect to main app

3. **Sign Up Process:**
   - User enters registration details
   - Comprehensive validation (email, password strength, name)
   - Better Auth API call
   - Session stored and user redirected

4. **Session Management:**
   - Automatic session refresh every 5 minutes
   - Session validation on app resume
   - Secure storage with expiration checking

5. **Sign Out:**
   - Clear session from Better Auth
   - Remove stored session data
   - Redirect to sign-in screen

## Security Features

- **Secure Storage:** All session data stored using Expo SecureStore
- **Session Expiration:** Automatic handling of expired sessions
- **Input Validation:** Client-side validation for all auth forms
- **Error Handling:** Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive info
- **CSRF Protection:** Better Auth provides built-in CSRF protection

## Testing

- Unit tests for AuthContext functionality
- Component tests for ProtectedRoute behavior
- Validation tests for auth utilities
- Integration tests for auth flow

## Configuration

The authentication system requires the following environment variable:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Base URL for the API server

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **1.1** - Secure authentication using Better Auth
✅ **1.2** - Session management with automatic refresh
✅ **1.3** - Proper error handling and user feedback
✅ **1.4** - Authentication state management
✅ **8.1** - Mobile-optimized interface
✅ **8.2** - Smooth navigation and transitions
✅ **8.3** - Immediate feedback and loading indicators

## Next Steps

The authentication and navigation structure is now complete and ready for the next implementation tasks:

- Task 9: Build household management mobile screens
- Task 10: Implement inventory management mobile interface
- Task 11: Build shopping list mobile interface with real-time sync

The foundation provides secure, user-friendly authentication that integrates seamlessly with the Better Auth backend and supports all planned features of the meal planner application.
